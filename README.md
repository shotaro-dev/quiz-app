[![Live Demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/Live_Demo-👀_Click_here!-blue?style=for-the-badge&logo=vercel)](https://quiz-app-nu-drab.vercel.app/)

A small, accessible quiz application implemented in plain (vanilla) JavaScript. It is intended as a learning example or a lightweight prototype. The app focuses on being simple, keyboard-friendly, and accessible.

## How this project was built

- Learning project
- Initial skeleton generated with GitHub Copilot
- The rest was vibe-driven development with heavy AI assistance
- Every line was **reviewed, tested, and either kept with confidence or rewritten/deleted by me**  
  → The final code contains only what I'm confident in and take responsibility for

## Features

- Lightweight client-side implementation
- You can provide a seed to reproduce the same question order using the `seed` input field.
- Keyboard-first interactions
- Supports Tab, Enter, Space, and arrow keys so the quiz can be fully operated from the keyboard.
- Score and high score
  - The results screen shows the current score.
  - High scores (best correct answers) are saved to `localStorage` using the key `quiz_highscore_v1` and displayed on the results screen.
- Responsive, modern UI
  - Simple card-based UI with responsive layout for mobile and desktop.
